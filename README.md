# Project - QuantX
This is the first and basic version of the QuantX.
<br>
### It consists of following components:
<br>
-> A data folder which contains all the relevant raw real time data about financial instruments in respective folders, as well as the processed data.
<br>
-> A lib directory which contains all the scripts containing core logic of the project.
<br>
-> A launch script that is the main script of the project, and it is to be run to launch the project. For now, the trades are only suggested, and they need to be ordered manually.
<br>
-> A csv file that contains the current portfolio. For now, we manually update it.
<br>
-> A json file containing all the state variables. For now, we manually update it.
<br>
